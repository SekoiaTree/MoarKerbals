[0.90] MoarKerbals - Populate your colony in space! (v1.1) [2014/12/27]

Kerbthulhu Kinetics Program's MoarKerbals

This is a fairly simple mod that adds two parts, an orbital station and ground station Klone Bay, that lets you klone your kerbals. There's a small chance that an accident can happen - this is experimental technology after all :wink: You can disable accidents or change the requirements in the part's .cfg file if you want, or just save before operating.

It requires a large amount of electricity to operate, and I always play with Roverdude's MKS and TAC's Life Support, so it automatically integrates with them to require Biomass or other materials. Also, I included configs for the Community Tech Tree. Both require ModuleManager to integrate.

MoarKerbals was inspired by my desire to have a small colony of Kerbals living in zeppelins around Jool who populate the planet, evolve their own society, and then to go to war with the "grounders" back on Kerbin.

This is my first mod and it runs fine on both my 32bit/64bit installs, so let me know if you find any bugs. All constructive feedback/suggestions are also welcome. Enjoy!

To do

    Kerbal Inheritance
    I plan on adding a second part, the "Kuddle Shack" that will let you make new Kerbals in the more... traditional sense.
    Recipes may require re-balancing
    Kerbal training program for specialty

-Other mod idea: Use civilian/tourist kerbal setting to create base infrastructure requirements - X civilians to support Y sized base.

Known bugs

    Because I use the stock lander can for internals, which is only sized internally for two, if you clone a third kerbal into the bay it won't show up in the kerbal profiles at the bottom right. They will show up properly once you transfer them to another module though.
