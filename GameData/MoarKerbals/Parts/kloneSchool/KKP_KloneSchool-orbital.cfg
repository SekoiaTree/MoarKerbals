	description = Originally intended to reheat pizza, a new use was found for this when a Goo sample container was "accidentally" left inside.  Consumes large amounts of electricity to function.  WARNING: Because of the unstable nature of this device, biological samples coming out can differ from what went in! Keep your Kerbals clean and smelling fresh with Kerbal Washer 3000! Large loading door, massive 8 Kerbal capacity, customizable light color, Heavy/Standard/Gentle wash cycles with automatic shutoff and water conserving modes. Also functions as Airlock and Docking port.
