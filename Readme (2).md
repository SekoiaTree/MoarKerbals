MoarKerbals v1.1
================
This mod installs a Klone Bay that you can use to replicate new kerbals wherever you feel like.  It takes a fair amount of electricity, and when combined with USI's MKS mod or TAC Life Support, it will require biomatter as well.

There is a small chance for a freakish accident to occur, which can be disabled in the part's .cfg file, or you can just quicksave before kloning ;)

================
Installation
================
Just copy the GameData folder over to your Kerblal's install folder and enjoy.
